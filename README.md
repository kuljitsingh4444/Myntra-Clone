General Instructions:

0. Created using React CLI with Redux using modern hooks ( useDispatch, useSelector ) for state manegement.
1. Added an extra sort by rating feature along with other sorts requested.
2. All of the mock data is generated when app is loaded. Data generation code is in "mock.js". Only images are generated from web links ( rest of data is hardcoded in mock.js )
3. All the components for filters, buttons, radios, checkboxes, etc have been created with re-usability in mind.
4. App is developed for screen sizes 1920x1080 ( I have experience with media queries for responsive designs but I have kept the scope of the project simple )
5. Keeping scope of project in mind i have made the directory structure as modular as needed.

How to Run:

0. clone the reposiroty and go to root of project directory: "cd myntra-clone"
1. install all dependencied: "npm i"
2. start project: "npm run start"
